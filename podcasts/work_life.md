**Description**

As one of Apple Podcasts’ most downloaded new shows of 2018, WorkLife spent two weeks as the #1 show on the entire podcast chart.

Organizational psychologist Adam Grant takes you inside the minds of some of the world’s most unusual professionals to explore the science of making work not suck. From learning how to love criticism to harnessing the power of frustration, one thing’s for sure: You’ll never see your job the same way again.

**Notes**

## Episode 3: The Problem with All-Stars

* **Role Players are Important** Too many "high-performers" can underperform groups that have other role players. Egos can get in the way of the overall team's success. For example, in basketball you need people to dive after loose balls, play excellent defense, pass efficently, be in the right position to disrupt, etc. Points aren't all that matters. You need people on the team to do the little things. They make everyone else better.
* **Humility** Humility is staying grounded. You can be confident while staying humble.
* **Moral Elevation** when we see someone else doing the right thing we are also more likely to do the right thing.
> It's the colleague who stays late to help out the team, the boss who shows up to fix a broken copy machine, the client who opens up her personal network to help you find leads for a new job

* **Emotional Contagion** Emotions spread throughout the team. They can be positive or negative. Needs to be context specific
* **Universal Accountability** Everyone is responsible. Everyone is accountable.
* **Cultivate Humility** Even though your humility is apparent after success, but it should be culitvated long before. Practice it now. 


### Aside on Meetings
* Everyone is on time
* Limit the attendees
* Everyone does the homework and is prepared
* Keep them short: 15 minutes


## Episode 2: The Daily Show's Secret to Creativity

Comments taken from: https://www.leoketel.com/2018/03/burstiness-is-the-key-to-the-best-and-most-innovative-teams/

* Centers on the writers room at the Daily Show
* **Burstiness** when your group creative brainstorm is bursting with ideas. Maybe people are talking over each other. It’d like a raucous family gathering. And it results in some of the best ideas in a short amount of time.
* **Psychological safety** There must be a sense of mutual respect. And that comes with feeling safe to express a really dumb idea for someone else to launch from. This safety should come from the leaders of the team.
* **Welcome criticism** Despite the old concept that all ideas are good ideas, the welcome criticism concept **allows for standards**.
* **Lowered inhibitions** Studies show that the teams with the best innovations have lower inhibitions. In the paper clip study, two teams competed for the best new ideas for the use of a paper clip. The teams with the most creative ideas, like an emergency suture and a new form of art, **shared embarrassing stories with one another first**.
* **Task bubbles** The creative process has to move along like a well-oiled machine. Each stage of the creative process, from conception to the finished project must have clearly defined task bubbles, where team members are very clear about their role in the end result at any given time.
* **The right mix of people** Diverse groups are more creative.
* **Practicing together** Regular brainstorm practice helps to solidify the team.
* **Think team first** Instead of looking for creative individuals, think of creative teams as the solution and hire creative teams as a unit. Or try to create a complete unit.


## Episode 1: How to Love Criticism


* Centers on Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Capital. Bridgewater takes feedback to an extreme, but also sees it as a driver of their success.
* **Criticism Aversion is Natural** Feedback (especially negative feedback) automatically puts us on the defensive. We are hard-wired to treat feedback as an attack. However, without feedback we're unlikely to be able to improve.
* **Sincerely Trying Helping** Feedback is better received if it is interpreted as being meant to be helpful. This is all based on trust and a feeling of safety. If the person you're providing feedback to does not trust you or feel safe around you they are unlikely to accept it well.
* **Watch the Tape** Much like all levels of sport teams watch tape to see what they did well and what they can improve on, we should be constantly looking for opportunities to review our performance.
* **Proving vs Improving** Proving is emotional and protective. "I'm trying to prove my worth" whereas Improving is curious and all about getting to better results.
* **2nd Score** Don't only judge on performance, but give a 2nd rating: How you take the feedback on your performance. Even if you don't do well at first you can always take feedback well and use it to perform better the next time.
* **Don't Be Afraid of the Mirror**
