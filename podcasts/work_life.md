From learning how to love criticism to harnessing the power of frustration, one thing’s for sure: You’ll never see your job the same way again.

**Notes**

## Episode 1: How to Love Criticism

* Centers on Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Capital. Bridgewater takes feedback to an extreme, but also sees it as a driver of their success.
* Feedback (especially negative feedback) automatically puts us on the defensive. We are hard-wired to treat feedback as an attack. However, without feedback we're unlikely to be able to improve.
* Key 1: Feedback is better received if it is interpreted as being meant to be helpful. This is all based on trust and a feeling of safety. If the person you're providing feedback to does not trust you or feel safe around you they are unlikely to accept it well.
* Key 2: Watch the Tape. Much like all levels of sport teams watch tape to see what they did well and what they can improve on, we should be constantly looking for opportunities to review our performance.
* Proving vs Improving Mode - Proving is emotional and protective. "I'm trying to prove my worth" whereas Improving is curious and all about getting to better results.
* Key 3: Don't only judge on performance, but give a 2nd rating: How you take the feedback on your performance. Even if you don't do well at first you can always take feedback well and use it to perform better the next time.
* Key 4: Don't be afraid to look in the mirror.
